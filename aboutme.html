        <p style="font-family:courier;text-align:center;"> Hi! My name is Andrea Lindner, <br> and I'm learning how to code! <br> I am a rising senior at <br> John F. Kennedy High School in New York, <br> and I love  to read, paint, knit, and bake. </p>

        <p id="demo"> (7/11/17) <br> 1. Scratch and Python are both similar in their concepts. They both involve the core4, which is loops, conditionals, functions, and variables. They are different in that Scratch gives blocks we can drag and click to create our programs, and with Python, we have to type our code ourselves. <br> 2. Debugging a program has to be one of the most annoying things to do, howeverv once you get the computer where you want it, it becomes so satisfying. I love when I fix my errors and make my program work, but finding the error can be a daunting task. <br>
            <br> (7/17/17) <br> -Today we learned the how to make an LED light work using a breadboard and Arduino. It was hard trying to figure out how the light will work and how to connect the button to work when it is pressed. From this experience, I learned that sometimes you have to ask for help and do some research in addition to your own trial and error. It was certainly a challenge trying to learn on the job how the power flows. <br> -My idea of robots has changed today because now I believe that robotics are not made to only help humans but instead to complete tasks. I am excited for what will come in the field of robotics, however, the idea of the robots having bugs in them or getting hacked makes me nervous for our future. <br>-In groups, we worked on circits. What worked best for us was delegating, asking for help, and using trial and error. Maybe next time we can delegate work even more? br>  
            <br> (7/20/17) <br> Today we learned how to use sensors on robots and program them. My group had a lot of trouble getting our robot to work as we functioned. <br> Together, we worked pretty well. We were supportive of others' ideas. <br>
            <br> (7/25/17) <br> -One new thing I learned about the internet is that information is send in packets and passes through the router which directs them where to go. <br> -Based on the description, I think kLaTeX s a markup language, because similar to HTML and CSS, it is used to format documents. <br>
            <br> (7/25/17) <br> -I would create a new pinterest with the same structure as in my portfolio page. <br> -I felt confident with the concept of what Django does and is all about. 
            <br> (7/26/17) <br> -I don't have my site set up yet, but if I could add things to it, I would add links to my work on it.
            <br> (8/3/17) <br> - I wasn't here yesterday so I don't know what the limitations of our social network program are. <br> - it would be useful and interesting to add idk man <br> -I am most proud of figuring out how classes work and how functions work. <br> -I am most excited for learning how to actually create things and make something that helps and inspires people.

     <p style="font-family:courier;text-align:center;"> Hi! My name is Andrea Lindner, <br> and I'm learning how to code! <br> I am a rising senior at <br> John F. Kennedy High School in New York, <br> and I love  to read, paint, knit, and bake. </p>
     <p style="color: #16A085;font-family:courier;"> (7/11/17) <br> 1. Scratch and Python are both similar in their concepts. They both involve the core4, which is loops, conditionals, functions, and variables. They are different in that Scratch gives blocks we can drag and click to create our programs, and with Python, we have to type our code ourselves. <br> 2. Debugging a program has to be one of the most annoying things to do, howeverv once you get the computer where you want it, it becomes so satisfying. I love when I fix my errors and make my program work, but finding the error can be a daunting task. </p>
